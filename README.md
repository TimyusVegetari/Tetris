# Goal of the game
For this first version, it's just a classic tetris. You must encapsulate the tetriminos to have between one and four lines to increase your score. You can speed up the tetriminos and win bonus points. For each level, you must accumulate enough lines to level up. The speed of the tetriminos upgrade when you pass a new level. A playfield full means gameover.
Good game :)
