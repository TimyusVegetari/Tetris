 Goal of the game:
   For this first version, it's just a classic tetris. You must encapsulate
   the tetriminos to have between one and four lines to increase your score.
   You can speed up the tetriminos and win bonus points. For each level,
   you must accumulate enough lines to level up. The speed of the tetriminos
   upgrade when you pass a new level. A playfield full means gameover.
   Good game :)
